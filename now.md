## :computer:

I'm just getting started at [Gretel](https://gretel.ai), focusing on platform security compliance.
I don't have a particularly active open source side project right since getting [Sandu](https://github.com/mikeknep/sandu) basically MVP-feature-complete.

I'm trying out VS Code as my daily driver editor instead of my beloved vim+tmux setup. We'll see how long this experiment lasts...

## :musical_note:

I play tenor and alto saxophones in a big band and a smaller jazz combo group.
Oddly, the three tunes I am currently most focused on getting more comfortable with all start with `J`: "Joy Spring," "Joshua," and "James."

I also enjoy playing piano at home, though most of the time that takes the form of transcribing chord progressions to pop tunes or practicing major scales as a mental break from work.

## :bike:

As the weather gets better and my bike rides get longer, I'm eager to learn more about how to properly maintain my bike instead of always taking it to a shop for tune-ups.
I'd like to get to a point where I'm comfortable making modifications like replacing derailleurs or cassettes.
It's fun to work on something physically tangible!
