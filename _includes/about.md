## Hi! I'm Mike. (And that's Tapu.)

Welcome to my corner of the internet, where I share some evolving WIP notes (:avocado:) and more formal posts (:hot_pepper:).
Three quick-hitting "about me"s:
- I write software at [8th Light](https://www.8thlight.com/) :computer:
- I play saxophone in the Lakeside Pride Jazz Orchestra and combo :saxophone:
- I pay too much attention to the NBA :basketball:
